## Purpose

This hero section is going to be the landing page for a music lesson resource that I am building for drummers. It is being built with my students in mind in particular and will feature downloadable sheet music that I have written in the music markup language [lilypond](https://lilypond.org/). 

Eventually I would like to have this feature small instructional videos, a way for students to message me with questions, and links to other great drumming resources. However it's first purpose is to provide a space for my students to access lesson resources.

### Client

As a developer I am my own client. But really this is for my students, who are the real client.

### Notes:

* This layout corrected the problems that I had in my cpnt260-a3. The issue was because I didn't have much content in the main section. To fix it, the main class has a height of 100vh to keep the header and footer in their places

* While I wanted to put more energy into the menu to give it smother animations. I decided to focus on improving my grid layouts.

* The drum icon used in the bullets is an svg that I designed in inkscape.

* I have saved the lilypond files and some of the sheet music pdfs in the assets, but I haven't linked to any of them yet
