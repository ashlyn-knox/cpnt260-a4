## Purpose
This hero section is going to be the landing page for a music lesson resource that I am building for drummers. It is being built with my students in mind in particular and will feature downloadable sheet music that I have written in the music markup language [lilypond](https://lilypond.org/). 

Eventually I would like to have this feature small instructional videos, a way for students to message me with questions, and links to other great drumming resources. However it's first purpose is to provide a space for my students to access lesson resources.

### Client
As a developer I am my own client. But really this is for my students, who are the real client.
